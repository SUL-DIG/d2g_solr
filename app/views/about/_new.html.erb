<h4>New Entries, Comments, and Corrections</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original database, compiled by Richard Parrillo, spanned the years 1589-1995. With your assistance we hope to continue to add entries for operas and oratorios on a semi-annual basis.<p>
<p>New entries may be submitted via the “Submit a Premiere” link. Please note that documentation of the source of your information is required, in the form of a bibliographical citation to a published resource. Alternately, you may upload a scanned image of a concert program that includes the work title, composer name, date and place of the premiere.</p>
<p>Corrections to existing data, and comments on individual entries, may be submitted using the “Report a Problem” link at the top right. Please note that documentation of the source of your information is required, in the form of a bibliographical citation to a published resource. Corrections to existing data will be made following verification by Stanford staff. Comments are vetted and may be added to the individual item screens.</p>
